## About

This project explores the creation of a functional online ordering system for a pizzeria. Implemented following the MVC model, the system integrates different aspects of an e-commerce platform, from pizza viewing to order processing and inventory management. Visitors can browse the available pizzas and add items to the cart without needing to create an account, providing a simplified and smooth user experience.

The system's goal is to simulate a real online ordering environment, where customers can register, log in, and track their orders. Additionally, the system includes advanced features such as promotions handling, delivery address validation, and order management, offering a comprehensive view of how to develop a robust and scalable PHP application. This project demonstrates how best programming practices and an efficient database structure can be applied to meet the needs of a real-world client.
